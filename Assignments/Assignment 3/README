The uploaded pdf [in the folder Assignment 2] contains instructions(2+3) for Assignment 2 and 3 and the template zip file at the end.

Major tasks for this Assignment 3 are:

Task 5. Complete the EntropyEvaluator class
 
Task 6. Complete the GainInfoItem class

Task 7. Complete the InformationGainEvaluator class

This archive contains the 13 files. 5 of the files are of Assignment 3, that is, this file (README.txt),
the files EntropyEvaluator.java, GainInfoItem.java, InformationGainCalculator.java, StudentInfo.java.
There are 8 files from Assignment 2,(updated) that are : AttributeType.java, DataReader.java, DataSet.java, Util.java, 
CSVReader.java, Attribute.java, ActualDataSet.java, VirtualDataSet.java,

In Assignment 3 we considered all possible partitions of the input data that we already read into a matrix and
"split" (in Assignment 1 and 2). Different classes were created to calculate Entropy and Gain. The DataSet can now
now be split over an attribute, both numerical or nominal attribute, which gives the lowest entropy.
