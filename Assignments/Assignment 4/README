The uploaded pdf contains instructions4 for Assignment 4 and the template zip file at the end.

Major Tasks for Assignment 4 :

Task 1: Build a decision tree for given dataset.

Task 2: Write a toString() method that provides an if-else representation of the decision tree. The toString() method
        will call a recursive toString(...) method. 
       
Task 3: Implement exception handling for the methods in DecisionTree, as well as for the methods in
        the three classes you developed in Assignment 3.
        
This archive contains the 13 files. 2 of the files are of Assignment 4, that is, this file (README.txt),
and DecisionTree.java.
The 3 files from Assignment 3 that have been updated with exceptions are EntropyEvaluator.java, GainInfoItem.java,
InformationGainCalculator.java 
There are 8 files from Assignment 2 solution (provided), that are : AttributeType.java, DataReader.java, 
DataSet.java, Util.java, CSVReader.java, Attribute.java, ActualDataSet.java, VirtualDataSet.java

In Assignment 4 we considered all possible partitions of the input data that gave the best split and created a 
decision tree based on the attribute that gave the highest information gain. DecisionTree was created to 
keep track of the Nodes of the decision tree using recursive programming and linked lists. Exceptions were
added when appropriate in the files of A4 and A3.
